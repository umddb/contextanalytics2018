          <b>Naresh Agarwal</b><br/>
          <b>Simmons School of Library and Information Science</b><br/>
          <b>Title: What do we mean when we talk about Context?</b><br/>
          <b>Bio: </b> Naresh Agarwal is an Associate Professor at the Simmons School of Library and Information Science (College  of  Organizational,  Computational,  and  Information  Sciences)  in  Boston,  Massachusetts.  He earned his Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Department of Information Systems, School of Computing. Naresh has published more than 40 articles in international journals, conference proceedings, and as book chapters in the fields of information behavior and knowledge management. Naresh looks at the way people look for information and the contextual factors that impact their choice of information sources. He seeks to understand and synthesize the apparent contradictions in this phenomenon and tries to reconcile multiple perspectives. His book 'Exploring Context in Information Behavior: Seeker, situation, surroundings, and shared identities' was recently published by Morgan & Claypool. Naresh also studies serendipitous information encountering and the causes and effects — both on the recipient and the sender — of information stopping and information avoidance behaviors, especially by people who use smartphones and social media. Naresh teaches courses in technology and web development, theories of information science, knowledge management, and evaluation of information services. He has held various leadership positions at ASIS&T (the Association for Information Science and Technology). He was a member of its Board of Directors from 2012–2014. Naresh was the Chair of its Membership Committee (2015–2017), the Conference Co-Chair of its 80th Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., Oct. 27–Nov. 1, 2017, and was awarded the ASIS&T James M. Cretsos Leadership Award in 2012. Prior to entering the doctoral program at NUS, Naresh worked for six years in technology roles in the voice-over-IP, bioInformatics, and digital cinema industries.
